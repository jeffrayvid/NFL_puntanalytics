My kaggle submission for the NFL Punt Analytics competition

In the repository you will find my ipynb and my powerpoint presentation. 

The object of this competition was to propose 
specific rule modifications (e.g. changes to the initial formation, tackling techniques, blocking rules etc.), supported by data, 
that may reduce the occurrence of concussions during punt plays.
