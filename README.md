# NFL_puntanalytics
My kaggle submission for the NFL Punt Analytics competition, where I was one of four finalists selected to present recommendations to NFL executives, coaches and data scientists at the NFLâ€™s 1st and Future Conference in Atlanta during Super Bowl weekend

In the repository you will find my ipynb and my powerpoint presentation. 

The object of this competition was to propose 
specific rule modifications (e.g. changes to the initial formation, tackling techniques, blocking rules etc.), supported by data, 
that may reduce the occurrence of concussions during punt plays.
